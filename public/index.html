                <h2>The Moon is lemon-shaped</h2>
                <p>Despite its appearance in the night sky, our natural satellite is nowhere near round. In fact, the Moon is shaped like a lemon, with flattened poles and bulges on both the near and far side around its equator. This strange shape is thought to have been created during interactions with Earth soon after its formation.</p>

                <h2>Black holes aren't actually holes</h2>
                <p>Black holes are incredibly dense objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape. They are not empty but rather filled with a massive amount of matter packed into a very small area.</p>
